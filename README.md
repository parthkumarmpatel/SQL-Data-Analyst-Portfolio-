# 📊 Advanced SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Query

This project showcases **advanced SQL techniques** applied to a **Data Warehouse** for deep data analysis and reporting. It demonstrates how to extract meaningful insights, compute key business KPIs, and build reusable reporting structures using SQL.

---

## 🚀 **Highlights**
✅ Comprehensive EDA on sales data using SQL  
✅ Time-based analysis with `DATETRUNC`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`  
✅ Running totals and moving averages for trend analysis  
✅ Year-over-year and average comparisons with window functions  
✅ Revenue contribution analysis by category  
✅ Customer segmentation based on spending and lifespan  
✅ Product segmentation by cost and sales performance  
✅ Creation of detailed **customer** and **product** reports (with KPIs like AOV, monthly spend, recency)

## 📌 **Techniques Used**
- **Window functions**: `LAG`, `AVG`, `SUM OVER`, `ROW_NUMBER`  
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: For structured, modular queries  
- **Conditional logic**: `CASE WHEN` for dynamic segmentation  
- **Aggregate functions**: `SUM`, `COUNT DISTINCT`, `AVG`, `ROUND`  
- **Date functions**: `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `DATEDIFF`, `DATETRUNC`

## 🗂 **Key Components**
- 🗄 Database & table structure exploration  
- 📈 Sales trends (monthly, yearly) + running total / moving average  
- 🛍 Product performance (average price, revenue ranking, segmentation)  
- 👥 Customer behavior (spend, recency, segmentation: VIP / Regular / New)  
- 📝 Creation of **customer report view** for easy BI/dashboard integration  
- 📝 Product-level performance report with KPIs

## 💡 **How to use**
Run the SQL scripts in a compatible SQL environment (SQL Server / Snowflake / BigQuery / Databricks) connected to your data warehouse. Adjust schema/table names (`gold.fact_sales`, `gold.dim_customers`, `gold.dim_products`) as needed for your database.
